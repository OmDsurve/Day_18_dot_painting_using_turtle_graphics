# Day_18_dot_painting_using_turtle_graphics
I created a Python project using turtle graphics to replicate Damien Hirst's famous dot painting. The script generates 100 randomly colored dots in a grid, mimicking the style of the million-dollar artwork. This project blends art with code, demonstrating how creativity and programming can produce stunning digital masterpieces.
